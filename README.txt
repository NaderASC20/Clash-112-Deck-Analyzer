DESCRIPTION:
“Clash Royale” is an extremely popular mobile strategy game where players battle each other in 1v1 or 2v2 battle using “decks”, a set of 8 cards of the user’s choice from the 106 available cards in the game.

This project is called "Clash 112 Deck Analyzer". It is an app
that allows a user to input a Clash Royale deck of their choice and receive a thorough analysis for said deck.

The analyzer matches your deck up against 4 other popular decks in the game.
It provides intelligent card suggestions for replacing the card in your deck
that gets countered the most by the matchup decks. These card suggestions
synergize well with the other cards in your deck.

There is also a simulation component to the analyzer.
The user can simply press "s" on the analysis screen to be presented with a
complete simulation of their deck matched up against the best possible counter deck.
This simulation allows the user to view interactions between their cards and
the matchup cards which may provide useful insight into the
strategies they will choose when playing Clash Royale.

INSTRUCTIONS:
Run Main.py. Simply click on a card image to add that card to your deck.
Repeat until your deck is completely full. Once it is full, hit the big green
"Analyze!" button that pops up. Once on the analysis screen, press the "s" key
to view a simulation of your deck against the best possible matchup against your deck.
